        <summary>VAR.IABLES</summary>
        <p>
          In JavaScript, identifiers are case-sensitive and can contain Unicode letters, $, _, and digits (0-9), but may
          not start with a digit. Use camelCase naming with meaningful words. Reserved keywords:
          https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_reserved.asp
        </p>
        <dl>
          <dt>HOISTING</dt>
          <dd>In JavaScript, a variable can be declared after it has been used. In other words; a variable can be used
            before it has been declared.</dd>
          <dd>Hoisting is JavaScript's default behavior of moving all declarations to the top of the current scope (to
            the
            top of the current script or the current function).</dd>
          <dd>Variables defined with let and const are hoisted to the top of the block, but not initialized. Meaning:
            The
            block of code is aware of the variable, but it cannot be used until it has been declared.</dd>
          <dd>Using a let variable before it is declared will result in a ReferenceError. The variable is in a "temporal
            dead zone" from the start of the block until it is declared.</dd>
          <dd>Using a const variable before it is declared, is a syntax error, so the code will simply not run.</dd>
          <dd>JavaScript only hoists declarations, not initializations.</dd>
          <dt>TIP:</dt>
          <dd>Hoisting is (to many developers) an unknown or overlooked behavior of JavaScript.</dd>
          <dd>If a developer doesn't understand hoisting, programs may contain bugs (errors).</dd>
          <dd>To avoid bugs, always declare all variables at the beginning of every scope.</dd>
          <dd>Since this is how JavaScript interprets the code, it is always a good rule.</dd>
          <dd>JavaScript in strict mode does not allow variables to be used if they are not declared.</dd>
        </dl>
        <dl>
          <dt>SCOPING</dt>
          <dd>In JavaScript, objects and functions are also variables.</dd>
          <dd>The lifetime of a JavaScript variable starts when it is declared.</dd>
          <dd>Scope determines the accessibility of variables, objects, and functions from different parts of the code.
          </dd>
          <dt>Block Scope</dt>
          <dd>Variables (let, const) declared inside a { } block cannot be accessed from outside the block.</dd>
          <dd>Variables declared with the var keyword can NOT have block scope.</dd>
          <dd>Variables (var) declared inside a { } block can be accessed from outside the block.</dd>
          <dt>Local / Function Scope</dt>
          <dd>Variables declared within a JavaScript function, become LOCAL to the function. They can only be accessed
            from within the function.</dd>
          <dd>Since local variables are only recognized inside their functions, variables with the same name can be used
            in different functions.</dd>
          <dd>Local variables are created when a function starts, and deleted when the function is completed.</dd>
          <dd>JavaScript has function scope: Each function creates a new scope.</dd>
          <dd>Variables defined inside a function are not accessible (visible) from outside the function.</dd>
          <dd>Variables declared with var, let and const are quite similar when declared inside a function. They all
            have
            Function Scope.</dd>
          <dd>Function (local) variables are deleted when the function is completed.</dd>
          <dd>Function arguments (parameters) work as local variables inside functions.</dd>
          <dt>Global Scope</dt>
          <dd>A variable declared outside a function, becomes GLOBAL. A global variable has Global Scope: All scripts
            and
            functions on a web page can access it.</dd>
          <dd>Variables declared with var, let and const are quite similar when declared outside a block. They all have
            Global Scope.</dd>
          <dd>If you assign a value to a variable that has not been declared, it will automatically become a GLOBAL
            variable.</dd>
          <dd>You can declare a global variable, even if the value is assigned inside a function.</dd>
          <dd>In "Strict Mode", undeclared variables are not automatically global.</dd>
          <dd>With JavaScript, the global scope is the JavaScript environment.
            <ul>
              <li>In HTML, the global scope is the window object.</li>
              <li>Global variables defined with the var keyword belong to the window object.</li>
              <li>Global variables defined with the let keyword do not belong to the window object.</li>
            </ul>
          </dd>
          <dt>WARNING:</dt>
          <dd>Do NOT create global variables unless you intend to.
            <ul>
              <li>Your global variables (or functions) can overwrite window variables (or functions).</li>
              <li>Any function, including the window object, can overwrite your global variables and functions.</li>
              <li>In a web browser, global variables are deleted when you close the browser window (or tab).</li>
            </ul>

        <dt>Primitive types</dt>
        <dd>All primitive types define immutable values (that is, values which can't be changed). For example, strings
          are immutable. We refer to values of these types as "primitive values".</dd>
        <dd>'new' constructor keyword: This way we can see the primitive values' methods and properties too.</dd>

        <dt>Reference types - Everything in JS is an Object.</dt>

      </details>

      <details>
        <summary>Functions</summary>
        <p>In JavaScript every function is an object. An object is a collection of key:value pairs. If a value is a
          primitive (number, string, boolean), or another object, the value is considered a property. If a value is a
          function, it is called a 'method'.</p>
        <p>Within the scope of an object, a function is referred to as a method of that object. It is invoked from the
          object namespace 'MyObj.theMethod()'. Since we said that a function is an object, a function within a function
          can be considered a method of that function.</p>
        <p>You could say things like “I am going to use the save method of my object.” And "This save method accepts a
          function as a parameter.” But you generally wouldn't say that a function accepts a method as a parameter.</p>
        <p>We invoke method with '.', we invoke function like this: functionName();</p>

        <dl>
          <dt>Parameters are properties of a function.</dt>
          <dd>Parameters (if any) define the method signature.</dd>
          <dt>Arguments are properties of a particular call to a function.</dt>
          <dd>Arguments are values passed into a function.</dd>
        </dl>

        <p>When you define a function, the variables that represent the values that will be passed to it for processing
          are called parameters. However, when you use a function, the value you pass to it is called an argument.</p>

        <summary>Array Buffer</summary>
        <p>
          In JavaScript, an ArrayBuffer is an object that represents a generic, fixed-length raw binary data buffer. It
          is part of the TypedArray and DataView interfaces, which provide a way to work with binary data in a more
          controlled manner than the traditional JavaScript arrays.
        </p>

        <dl>
          <dt>Type Conversion:</dt>
          <dd>ArrayBuffer itself is not meant for direct manipulation, but rather as a low-level foundation for other
            more specific views. You can use TypedArrays or DataViews to interact with the data in the buffer. For
            example:</dd>
          <dt>Use case #1 - Low-Level Data Manipulation</dt>
          <dd>ArrayBuffer is useful when you need to work with binary data directly, like parsing or manipulating
            network protocols, file formats, or any other binary data.</dd>
          <dt>Use case #2 - Data Transfer:</dt>
          <dd>It's often used in APIs that involve transferring binary data, such as the Fetch API, WebSockets, or
            WebGL.</dd>
          <dt>Use case #3 - Efficient Memory Handling:</dt>
          <dd>ArrayBuffer allows for efficient memory handling, as it represents a fixed-size buffer and can be used for
            efficient data manipulation without the overhead of JavaScript arrays.</dd>
          <dt>Use case #4 - Interoperability:</dt>
          <dd>It's useful when dealing with other web technologies or external libraries that work with binary data,
            providing a common interface for data exchange.</dd>
        </dl>

        <p>In summary, ArrayBuffer provides a way to work with binary data in a more controlled and efficient manner in
          JavaScript, allowing for low-level manipulation and interoperability with other technologies.</p>

        <summary>Garbage collection</summary>

        <p>Garbage collection is the process by which a programming language automatically reclaims memory that is no
          longer in use by the program. In JavaScript, memory is managed automatically by the JavaScript engine. When
          objects are created, they are allocated memory. When they are no longer reachable or referenced, they become
          eligible for garbage collection.</p>

        <dl>
          <dt>The most common algorithm used for garbage collection in JavaScript is the Mark and Sweep algorithm.
            Here's a simplified explanation of how it works:</dt>
          <dd>Mark: The garbage collector starts from the root of the application (global object or objects referenced
            from it) and marks all the objects it can reach.</dd>
          <dd>Sweep: It then sweeps through the memory, freeing up the space occupied by objects that were not marked in
            the previous step, as they are considered unreachable and can be safely removed.</dd>
        </dl>

        <p>JavaScript engines, like V8 in Chrome or SpiderMonkey in Firefox, use sophisticated algorithms and
          optimizations to perform garbage collection efficiently without causing noticeable pauses in the application.
